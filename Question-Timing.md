## Summary Statistics

### Timing Distribution
- **No delay (user action required)**: 29 blocks
- **1.0 second delay**: 11 blocks  
- **1.5 seconds delay**: 13 blocks
- **2.0 seconds delay**: 5 blocks
- **3.0 seconds delay**: 3 blocks
- **5.0 seconds delay**: 1 block (final message)

### Average Delays by Section
- **Opening**: 1.0s average
- **Connection & Context**: 1.6s average
- **Values & Beliefs**: 1.4s average
- **Motivations & Perceptions**: 1.5s average
- **Engagement & Barriers**: 1.5s average
- **Vision & Identity**: 1.25s average
- **Commitment & Next Steps**: 1.7s average
- **Closing & Demographics**: 2.1s average

### Total Automated Delay Time
If a user experiences all auto-advance blocks (unlikely due to branching):
- **Maximum total delay**: ~62 seconds
- **Typical user path delay**: ~25-35 seconds

### Performance Considerations
1. **Quick responses** (1.0s) used for acknowledgments and transitions
2. **Medium delays** (1.5s) for contextual responses that need reading time
3. **Longer delays** (2.0-3.0s) for GIFs, celebrations, and important messages
4. **Extended delay** (5.0s) only for final message before redirect

### Recommendations
- Current timing provides good pacing without feeling rushed
- Celebration moments (GIFs) have appropriate viewing time
- Quick transitions keep conversation flowing naturally
- Consider monitoring actual user completion times vs these presets
- May want to reduce some 1.5s delays to 1.0s if users report slow pacing
