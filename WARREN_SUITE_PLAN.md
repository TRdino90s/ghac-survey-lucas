# Warren Product Suite - Integration Plan

## Overview
Transform the GHAC survey repository into the unified Warren Product Suite monorepo, leveraging the existing survey infrastructure as the foundation for all Warren tools.

## Current GHAC Structure (Foundation)
```
ghac-survey-lucas/
├── frontend/           # React survey interface (Build Burrows + Thicket)
├── backend/            # Express API + PostgreSQL (Data infrastructure)  
├── survey_structure.json # Survey schema (Data Models)
├── docs/               # Comprehensive documentation
└── scripts/            # Deployment and utilities
```

## Proposed Warren Suite Integration

### Phase 1: Restructure into Apps
```
apps/
├── build-burrows/      # Current frontend/ (Survey Builder + Chatbot)
├── hollow/             # Migrate Nesolagus dashboard (Analytics)
├── hatch/              # New Discovery Tool
├── outpost/            # New Outreach/Growth Tool  
├── thicket/            # New Landing Pages Tool
└── nest/               # New Activation Platform
```

### Phase 2: Shared Infrastructure  
```
packages/
├── shared-ui/          # Common React components, design system
├── data-models/        # Survey schemas, TypeScript types (from survey_structure.json)
├── api-client/         # Shared API communication layer
└── utils/              # Common utilities and helpers
```

### Phase 3: Unified Backend
```
backend/                # Expand existing Express backend
├── src/
│   ├── surveys/        # Existing survey logic
│   ├── analytics/      # New analytics endpoints (from Hollow)
│   ├── discovery/      # New discovery workflow endpoints
│   ├── outreach/       # New outreach management
│   └── shared/         # Common middleware, auth, utils
```

## Integration Strategy

### 1. Keep What Works
- **PostgreSQL database** - expand schema for all Warren tools
- **Express.js API** - extend with new Warren endpoints  
- **React/TypeScript frontend** - refactor into modular apps
- **Survey engine** - becomes core of Build Burrows
- **Deployment pipeline** - extend for monorepo

### 2. Extend What's Needed  
- **Add analytics backend** for Hollow integration
- **Create discovery workflow** for Hatch
- **Build shared component library** 
- **Implement cross-app data flow**

### 3. New Capabilities
- **Discovery → Survey** pipeline (Hatch → Build Burrows)
- **Survey → Analytics** pipeline (Build Burrows → Hollow)  
- **Analytics → Activation** pipeline (Hollow → Nest)
- **Unified user authentication** across all apps

## Data Flow Architecture

```
Hatch (Discovery) 
  ↓ Discovery Outline JSON
Build Burrows (Survey Builder)
  ↓ Survey Responses + Metadata  
Hollow (Analytics Dashboard)
  ↓ Community Intelligence Reports
Nest (Activation Platform)
```

## Technical Benefits

### Unified Development
- **Shared TypeScript types** from survey_structure.json
- **Common UI components** across all Warren tools
- **Single database** with unified schema
- **Consistent authentication** and user management

### Data Integration  
- **Survey responses** feed directly into analytics
- **Discovery insights** inform survey generation
- **Analytics outputs** drive activation campaigns
- **Cross-tool reporting** and insights

### Deployment Simplicity
- **Single repository** to manage and deploy
- **Shared infrastructure** reduces complexity  
- **Common environment configuration**
- **Unified CI/CD pipeline**

## Next Steps

1. **Rename repository** to `warren-product-suite` 
2. **Migrate Hollow dashboard** into `/apps/hollow`
3. **Refactor current frontend** into `/apps/build-burrows`
4. **Create shared packages** from existing code
5. **Build Hatch discovery tool** in `/apps/hatch`
6. **Extend backend** with Warren-specific endpoints

## Success Metrics

- **Seamless data flow** between all Warren tools
- **Reduced development time** through shared components
- **Unified user experience** across the product suite  
- **Scalable architecture** for future Warren tool additions
