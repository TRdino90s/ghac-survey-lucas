How Arts Affect Your Life: Responses,If You Could Change One Thing... Responses:
"I work for a large corporation and started off in a call center with limited creative outlets. I started painting by chance after attendinga paint night event years and years ago. Now I paint for fun, I’ve shown a few times but mostly I respect the arts, love to see it in our city/home, and think it’s essential for supporting people, communities and fellow artist. ",
the arts have always been an important part of my life - dance - music - literature and theater supporting all  art forms - I have always managed to incorporate the arts in all of my non profit organizations over tge pst 30+ years in Hartford! ,"The last GHAC survey I responded to I spoke mostly about a desire for more public art, much like how many cities (even local ones) had attracted projects like Pow Wow Worldwide (just an example, I have no idea about their specific viability or ethos) for more large scale mural work. I've been really pleased to see more large scale visual work since then, and would encourage the continuation of that!

For this survey, my pie-in-the-sky transformation would be about live music. 

Looking back through our family calendar, my partner and I have gone to btw 20-25 shows per year (all within driving distance - e.g. New England, NYC, Hudson Valley), the past few years. 

We have very broad musical interests. I would say no more than 2-3 of those shows per year were huge acts (let's say tickets above $100 per person). 

That said, of those 20-25 shows, on average usually ~4 are in CT, and there's only been 1 in the Greater Hartford area, the last 2 years.

While I love travelling to see live music, it seems silly that we're ALWAYS travelling to see live music, even more so for genres with strong historical footholds in the area. "
"Every day, small opportunities present themselves for me to seek out comfort, or to seek out challenge. While it's not always a strict dichotomy (i.e. there can be challenge in comfort, and vice versa), they do often present as two distinct pathways. I find art to be among the few things that can be equally pleasing/rewarding no matter which header it falls under. It is also one of the few areas of my life  where I feel fearlessly curious, and happy to follow where the unknown might lead. ",Don't forget about the little organizations outside of Hartford.  It seems that funding works from the city of Hartford out.
"I'm a peformer, director, teacher, and creator. I do improv, and play the flute. My kids are musicians. Many of my friends are performers and artists too."," GHAC plays a pivotal role in supporting our arts ecosystem by ""connecting the dots,"" facilitating partnerships, and promoting the arts in our community."
"I've been on the boards of two community choirs.  The one I'm involved with now I have served as president for 6 years.  By being involvement in these organizations, I learned how important they were to the local communities. The boards of these organizations were a group of members dedicated to performing great music to the community. Very few disagreements, everyone has the same goal. There missions were similar and both were fulfilling them. 
Singing is very important to people.  The first time I sang in the same room with a full orchestra I cried. I had never experienced singing literally amidst the music. It was moving through me.
I also have had many emotional times watching a musical at the Bushnell.  W attend often.  It's one of my favorite night out."," HIghlight individual artists in an array of endeavors and backgrounds, their personal stories, challenges, triumphs, impact, how GHAC advanced their journey.  Develop ways to showcase them in a variety of venues to a variety of audiences (some of this may already be done; perhaps more, with broader support and publicity, involving each community, geographic, demographic,  and otherwise. 
Perhaps accompanied, simultaneously or sequentially, with data that highlights the econonic impact, quality of life impact, and other measures for a vibrant and diverse arts community throughout the region."
Arts and culture have helped to broaden my understanding and appreciation for our community. It's adds meaning and relevance to my life., There was a partnership with Travelers this summer which brought musical artists to the Travelers Plaza for live performances.  I was aware these were happening and I was aware of the GHAC's connection to it because of emails from Travelers.  It's possible that I've been connected to some of the GHAC's work but not aware of the GHAC's connection because I wasn't brand-aware.  Perhaps ensuring the GHAC's contributions are branded in the moment would prompt my greater awareness.
"I've met incredibly talented artists - visual artists, poets and performers - who are great people.  That's where it begins, and their artistry is a reflection of who they are, and their ability to connect with others in meaningful and inspiring ways.  It is wonderful to appreciate their talent and who they are as individuals - and the abundant ways in which our community is enriched by their artistry and quality of their character.", I think it's important that the GHAC continues to evolve into an organization that connects artists with opportunities. That can take a lot of different forms for a lot of different people. We need to figure out what our role is within the arts community based on what the arts community currently needs the most.
"I tend to be an enthusiastic personality.  The arts fires that enthusiasm in a myriad of ways.  It validates and often depicts passions in my life and other times it presents new perspectives for me to explore to expand my mindset and understanding of the world and my place in it.  I am a fan of art in the form of painting, sculpture, drama, literature, and music."," I don't feel qualified to answer this question.  I believe GHAC is important to the community, but do not know enough about its day-to-day to have an opinion."
The arts build community and through my work supporting local artists I feel that I'm helping to strengthen that community. I take a lot of pride in that., For GHAC to be the resource guide when looking for artists to connect with or things to do in the area.
"Among all the arts, music is integral to my daily happiness and fulfillment.  I am a devoted listener, not at all a maker, but would be lost without that form of art in its many forms.  All live music is good music! I do also appreciate and support other art forms, and think artistic expression - and appreciation - are crucial for a full life."," As an artist, I have to take issue with the summertime Old State House performance program. If cancelled due to weather, the artist gets NOTHING. When I play a wedding or other event, I will receive half payment to compensate for holding the date and not taking any other opportunity. The spotted lantern fly is clear evidence of climate change, and thus the increased chance of sudden storms. This modern reality challenges GHAC’s mission to support artists if no compensation is available for elements beyond the artists’ control. Their financial obligations still exist, rain or shine. It makes me wonder if GHAC’s allegiance is to their donors or artists."
"Seeing a younger generation respond to an arts experience.  Art is a unique tool to allow people to find community, identity and to build self-confidence.", More inclusion of senior citizens in events promoted in GHAC emails
My livelihood has only been as an artist and arts educator.," I have very positive feelings toward GHAC, but I  have talked to artists who feel like it is a bit clicky and that there isn't as much transparency or consistency as there can be. Maybe small group meetings with different stakeholders coming together to learn about the current mission and priorities, understand past successes and challenges and the reasons for certain changes in policies and focus over time and then a discussion. Unfortunately such relationship building takes time when we are all so busy actually programming and promoting what we are already doing....but it is a crucial step in helping those programs become more successful and the community to feel whole."
"[Transcribed] I have been a member of the Hereford Symphony for over 60 years and I've gone to most Harvard symphony concerts for at least 75 years. I am a longtime subscriber to theaterworks Hartford Hartford stage playoffs on Park, and good speed, as well as

This recording keeps cutting out at the end. So I'm not sure if you are getting it or if you've already gotten it three or four times, but this is going to be the last time that I try to send it. It's got 37 seconds left, and I'm not sure what to do."," There needs to be balance between engaging artists outside of the community and local creatives. What I would like to see is more efforts to collaborate between arts communities. I would also like to see less siloed activity. Not everyone needs to be involved in everything, but I believe a community thrives when there is consistent communication and there are options for how to contribute to the success of what is happening. Local artists also need more opportunities for professional development. We should be preparing our local artists to be ready to work with the more widely recognized arts organizations in our region. It seems like many artists get overlooked because they don't know how to engage the organizations. It also seems like organizations need to engage artists in more meaningful ways."
"I am an artist, curator, and creative consultant from the Greater Hartford community. I grew up in the arts an developed into an arts professional because of my childhood experience with creatives."," Maybe do a two or three page news sheet showing different arts
Organizations and their
works."
Through dance originally in my youth. It carried on through college etc. My husband painted and I believe the arts tell the story of our times., There's a space in the arts community to support the artists and art-makers that I've observed can become crowded and sometimes dilute the support that can be generated for artists and arts creators.
"I grew up loving the TV and the movies, ended up studying it in College and moving out to Hollywood. What I found out, is that I just love the idea of storytelling. As part of my work, I help others to identify the story of their life and help them rewrite or ""re-right"" how they look at the past chapters, and give them the tools and confidence to become the authors of their own future. I also have studied and performed comedy and really think it is so important in helping us process the world around us and all that is happening within. I wish there was more opportunity to work with humor in our community beyond just going to see someone else perform."," I'd love to see a GHAC that is truly a uniting force for the Hartford arts community. I know at times that can be like herding cats, but it feels too often like GHAC is another arts organization fighting for my time and attention, rather than an organization making it easier for me to connect with the variety of fantastic arts organizations that are patron focused"
"The arts bring people together of all different backgrounds and experiences, and build bridges through which relationships and all sorts of change can happen"," I would like to see the Greater Hartford Arts Council remain transparent and intentionally include communities of color in its decision-making. This is essential for ensuring that Hartford’s communities of color have greater access, visibility, and information."
"My experience with the Neighborhood Studios program is what launched my career as an artist. Without it, I would have likely ended up in a much more boring career path."," One of the events that I run is the Hartford Taste, and for a few years, we have tried to work with GHAC, but each time the answer is no. This event supports the creative economy in so many ways, (food, (which many organizations consider an art form), music and art)."
"The arts have touched me deeply, giving me a stronger sense of connection with the community. They’ve inspired me and helped me discover the creativity within myself. As a preacher, my role every Sunday is to inspire others—and I use the Word as artistry, painting pictures that bring hope and meaning. Through the arts, I’ve also built meaningful relationships and learned to see the city of Hartford through many different lenses."," I am not really in the role of requesting grants these days, so I must be honest and say that I am only speaking from what I have heard from friends. 
What I have heard, is that in the last few years, GHAC has been more about promoting its own brand and less of a solid source of funds that especially small arts organizations depend on."
"I have had the opportunity to teach artists - offer them skills to help them thrive in the business environment. We can't assume that everyone knows how to run a business, interact with the community, show their value."," I'd like to see the Arts Council do a better job of reaching out to the arts community to obtain a schedule of events before publishing master events guides. Many times, pivotal events are left out."
"Well, way too long and/or too many stories but...
my partner and HartBeat co-founder used to say (something like) the work of theater is to make sense of this thing we call the human condition."," Find opportunities to broaden the connections that GHAC has with other arts stakeholders (artists and craftspeople, educators) from across the Hartford region"
"Music is my life and my passion. As a musician and an arts administrator, the arts have defined my childhood, adulthood, and career."," The Greater Hartford Arts Council is in a period of transition and I feel it's important right now to give time, space and support as things are being shaped."
I love the arts and they are great., Support Literary arts more; or provide opportunities to include literary arts with other types of art to create collaborative events and arts discussions. Develop more open forums where artists and community can have discourse on various topics within the arts community.
"The arts have been fundamental in my experience of the world and others, from appreciating the work of others to taking the time to  craft artistic pieces of my own, to playing and enjoying music with others",
"I'm a lifelong creative who became an art supporter and educator, which led to my current position as Executive Director of the Farmington Valley Arts Center in Avon.",
The Gifted and talented program through elementary school introduced me to the arts. The stage has been my first love ever since. I will always seek it out. The written word is my second love. Literary art shapes the world; where would we be without words?,
"[Transcribed] I am very connected to the Arts. I have been I started dancing when I was six years old and then I went professional at the age of 18 and then the majority of my career was spent traveling the world. Performing dance aerial gymnastics.
 Mostly. And now I'm into digital, art creation, and social media management, and creative writing, which I think is all part of that as well.",
The arts have always been a part of  me.  I consider myself as a creative person.,
My dad loved bringing me to live music and plays growing up. Now a big supporter of the arts as I am a photographer and dancer,
"I'm personally connected to the arts because of my upbringing. My father loves music and instilled the same love for music in me. I've been creatively writing since my youth. As I evolved, creative storytelling became a part of my life as well. Currently, I integrate the mediums of music, writing, and storytelling.",
