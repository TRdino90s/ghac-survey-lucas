### Major Landing Page Redesign (Commit: 9fa694c)
Completely transformed the discovery tool from dashboard-style to professional landing page:

**Design Improvements:**
- ✅ **Two-column layout**: Content left, form right (inspired by YouGov)
- ✅ **Hollow dashboard aesthetic**: Clean cards, refined typography, proper whitespace
- ✅ **Left-aligned content**: Natural flow vs. center-aligned blocks
- ✅ **Professional messaging**: "Transform your stakeholder engagement strategy"
- ✅ **Trust indicators**: Security badges, "Trusted by 100+ organizations"
- ✅ **Streamlined form**: Clean age verification and privacy compliance

**Key Changes:**
- Header font reduced from `text-4xl` to `text-2xl` (Hollow consistency)
- Replaced center-aligned hero with left-column value proposition
- Added numbered benefits with icons (1-2-3 flow)
- Right sidebar form with clean input styling
- Gray background with white content cards
- Trust badges and social proof elements

**Result:** Now functions as proper prospect-facing landing page instead of internal tool
